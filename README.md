Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction

#### What is the Mechanism of Action (MoA) of a drug? And why is it important?

In the past, scientists derived drugs from natural products or were inspired by traditional remedies. Very common drugs, such as paracetamol, known in the US as acetaminophen, were put into clinical use decades before the biological mechanisms driving their pharmacological activities were understood. Today, with the advent of more powerful technologies, drug discovery has changed from the serendipitous approaches of the past to a more targeted model based on an understanding of the underlying biological mechanism of a disease. In this new framework, scientists seek to identify a protein target associated with a disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. As a shorthand to describe the biological activity of a given molecule, scientists assign a label referred to as mechanism-of-action or MoA for short.

Here, I have tried performing and extendive explorative data analysis and different dimensionality reduction analysis using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa) completation data

As this is an multi-output regression problem statment, I have tried creating a small mini tutorial in exploring various algorithms to slove this problem. https://github.com/kiranfranklin999/Multi_output_regression

Soon!!!, I'll be pushing the various Algorithm that I have explored to MoA problem statements.
